### This repo collects my programming assignments from the Mathematics & Statistics for Machine Learning & Data Science (DeepLearning.AI) specialization 📚💡.
### It’s where equations meet Python 🐍✨.

## Main Topics

- Linear Algebra → vectors, matrices, row-reduction, eigenvalues

- Calculus → derivatives, gradients, optimization basics

- Probability & Statistics → distributions, expectation, variance, Bayes

- Analytical Methods → systems of equations, Gaussian elimination, back-substitution

- Applications to ML → loss functions, gradient descent, data representation
